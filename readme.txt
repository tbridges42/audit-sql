To use:

1. Run the exe file.
2. Select the source Excel file.
    The source Excel must have column headings in the first row. The first column must be route designations (number or
    county). The second column must be the polling place name. The third column must be the PPLID. The rest of the file
    will be ignored, so it can contain other data.
3. The program will output sql files in the directory where it is run.
4. Move the output sql files to a thumb drive
5. For each tablet, insert the thumb drive and double-click on the sql file for that route.
6. If asked, choose to open the file with SQL Server
7. SQL Server will take a while to load. When it does, click the Execute button (it has a red exclamation mark)
8. Verify that the route has been correctly loaded by opening the surveys.
